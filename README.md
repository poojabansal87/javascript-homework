# ufo-sightings-analysis
JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

The dataset used in this project contains all of the eye-witness reports for extra-terrestrial activity. The objective is to create a table dynamically based upon this dataset and allow users to filter the table data for specific values. Technologies used are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js.

## Technical Details

* Created a basic HTML web page.

* Using the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, written a code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Used a date form in HTML document and written JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
